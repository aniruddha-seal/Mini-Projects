# Mini-Projects
Codes of some small projects I have worked on

## 1. Solving the One Dimensional Schroedinger Equation numerically
Solved for the case of Harmonic Oscillator (V(x) = x^2) using Shooting Method to find the energy eigen values and then using 4th order Runge Kutta method to approximate the wave functions.
